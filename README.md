# Welcome to Blodged

This project is a continuation of the group application built in CST-339 (Java III) at Grand Canyon University. My goal for this continuation is to update the current structure to fit a communication website specifictally for coders with real-time updates on post, replies, and follows! I also plan to add daily coding challenges and other fun features to keep users intertained!
